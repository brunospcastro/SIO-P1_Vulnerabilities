1.Install mysql-server and mysql-client (if you already did it for the secure version you can skip this step)
2.run node app_sec/createDB.js
3.run node app_sec/insertDB.js
4.Run: sudo mysql -pyour_new_password (if you already did it for the secure version you can skip this two steps)
		-this password is defined on .env file in case of the secure app or in index.js in case of vulnerable
5.Run this two queries:
		-ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_new_password;
		-flush privileges;
6.there should be a .env page on /app_sec/.
(usually this file would never go to the repository but for simplicity when grading we decided to not add it to .gitignore )

7. finally run node index.js on the root dir of the app_sec.

8.In your browser access localhost:<port that is defined on .env>/
                or ships as 5000 by default

troubleshooting:
you might need to run : npm i jade@^1.11.0
