		-this password is defined on .env file in case of the secure app or in index.js in case of vulnerable
5.Run this two queries:
		-ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_new_password;
		-flush privileges;
6. finally run node index.js on the root dir of the app.
